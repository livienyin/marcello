    I am a Ph.D. student in Philosophy and my current research focus is in Epistemology and Philosophy of Law. In epistemology, I am interested in the role of probability and statistics in belief formation and decision making. In philosophy of law, I am interested in judicial disagreement, legal reasoning, and the philosophical foundations of Evidence Law. I have side interests in Greek philosophy (esp. Aristotle), in the nature of transcendental arguments, and in meta-philosophy. I am writing a dissertation on statistical evidence and probability in criminal trials. It is concerned with two questions: Can a criminal defendant be convicted on statistical evidence alone? 
    Can the criminal standard of proof `beyond a reasonable doubt' be understood in purely probabilistic terms?
